### Added
- `session` property in database connection options
- `certificate` property in database connection options

### Removed
- `sapPassport` property in database connection options, use `session.SAP_PASSPORT` instead.

Now a single token is expected.

## 3.0.0 - 2016-08-05

### Changed
- Removed additional functions attached to the returned HDB connection object (incompatible change).
  In previous versions the returned connection object was enriched with the following functions:
    - setSchema
    - setApplicationUser
    - unsetApplicationUser

  Those functions have been removed and we have provided a new function `updateConnectionOptions` instead,
  to be used as utility for setting the supported connection options.

- Read HANA service properties from environment as fallback if no HANA config provided has been removed.

- HANA config object no longer supports setting `userTokens` as string, it must be an object.

- Connection pooling API was changed incompatibly to fix issues with connection cleanup.
